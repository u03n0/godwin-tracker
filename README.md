Through the anonymity of the internet, people voice thier deepest, unsolicited opinions and views to others in private and publically.
Hate speech is the language of the troll. Godwin's Law is the theory that the longer an online (forum, texts, etc) discourse continues,
the higher the probability that a trivialization of the Holocaust will occur; more plainly, it won't take long for an ignorant comparison to Hitler, Nazis, the use of racial slurs, etc., to 
eventually surface.

We can take this a step further and apply it to all forms of hate speech and ignorant misinformed notions.

## Goal
The goal is to have:
1. chatbot and human
2. human and human
3. chatbot and chatbot

conversations monitored, to reveal in real-time the likelihood the discourse will slide into the troll's playground: hate.

## How to Use
(in progress)
### 2. Via Streamlit app
(in progress)
